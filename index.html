    <h1 style="color:rgb(255, 213, 73);">im Pi3RcE, a game and web developer</h1>
    <p>i really like making games and i enjoy using html and c#, i am interested in rust, lua and c too.</p>
    <p>as a game developer i have fallen to scope creep multiple times leading to <br> one of my projects to fail, which was a survival game named "Leg Century".</p>
    <p>some of the projects i am making are</p>
    <h3 style="color:rgb(225, 235, 226);">Lithium</h3>
    <p>lithium is a glorified horror walking simulator set in a world inspired by <br> the backrooms and the SCP universes. it has a similar gameplay to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/356670/Spookys_Jump_Scare_Mansion/">Spooky's jump scare mansion.</a></p>
    <h3 style="color:rgb(112, 111, 121);">Spider Sandbox</h3>
    <p>a sandbox game exploring the use of combustion and the power to create <br>machines, guns, engines, ships, planes, etc.</p>
    <h2>planned projects</h2>
    <p>some of the projects i always wanted to finish are</p>
    <p>BeansSC and Leg century.</p>
    <p>BeansSC is a car driving game similar to BeamNG.drive but made to run on <br>older devices and possibly the web.</p>
    <p>on the other hand Leg century was a weird survival game with weird inhumane<br> enemy designs made to disturb the player. it was also made to have a procedurally generated map.</p>
